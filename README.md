## Steps

### 1.Set up and import data into Amazon QuickSight

The NYC Taxi data set is in an S3 bucket. To import S3 data into Amazon QuickSight, use a manifest file. 


### 2.Create an ML-powered visual to forecast the future demand for taxis

After you import the data set into Amazon QuickSight SPICE, you can start creating analyses and visuals. Your goal is to create an ML-powered visual to forecast the future demand for taxis. For more information, see Forecasting and Creating What-If Scenarios with Amazon Quicksight.


### 3.Generate an ML-powered insight to detect anomalies in the data set

In Amazon QuickSight, you can add insights, autonarratives, and ML-powered anomaly detection to your analyses without ML expertise or knowledge. Amazon QuickSight generates suggested insights and autonarratives automatically, but for ML-powered anomaly detection, you need to perform additional steps.
